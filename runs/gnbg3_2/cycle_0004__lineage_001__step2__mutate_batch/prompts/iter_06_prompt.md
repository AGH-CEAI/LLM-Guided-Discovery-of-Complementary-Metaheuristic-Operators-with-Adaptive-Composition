This is iteration 6 of 10. Propose ONE replacement implementation for `_mutate_batch`.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
ASSIGNED STRATEGY CATEGORY FOR THIS ITERATION:
  Category F — Temporal / dynamical
  Track quantities ACROSS GENERATIONS: rates of change, autocorrelation, exponential moving averages of state, stagnation detection over a time window, drift of the mean. Single-generation snapshots are insufficient — you must use temporal information.

  (This category has been used 0 time(s) before. If > 0, your
  variant MUST take a different angle within the category — same family,
  different mechanism.)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

For reference, the full category menu is:
  A) Geometry / spatial: Operate on the literal geometric layout of points: pairwise distances, convex hull, centroid distances, k-NN structure, axis-aligned spread, projection onto principal axes. Avoid information-theoretic or fitness-based reasoning.
  B) Spectral / linear-algebraic: Use eigenvalues, singular values, condition numbers, rank, covariance shape, or matrix decompositions. Reason in terms of subspace alignment, anisotropy, or effective dimensionality.
  C) Information-theoretic / distributional: Use entropy, KL divergence, mutual information, distribution fitting (Gaussian, GMM, kernel density), or log-likelihood-based reasoning. Treat the population as a probability distribution to be characterised.
  D) Fitness-landscape / rank-based: Reason about fitness values directly: rank correlations, Spearman/Kendall coefficients, fitness percentiles, fitness-distance correlation, success-history. Do NOT use raw distances or covariance — only fitness signals.
  E) Topology / graph-based: Build a graph or topology over the population (k-NN graph, minimum spanning tree, neighborhood lattice, ring/star topology) and derive properties from connectivity, clustering, or path lengths.
  F) Temporal / dynamical: Track quantities ACROSS GENERATIONS: rates of change, autocorrelation, exponential moving averages of state, stagnation detection over a time window, drift of the mean. Single-generation snapshots are insufficient — you must use temporal information.
  G) Stochastic / sampling-based: Use Monte-Carlo sampling, bootstrap estimates, Latin hypercube / Sobol probes, or randomised projections to estimate the quantity of interest. The variant must be fundamentally stochastic in its computation.
  H) Hybrid / multi-strategy: Combine TWO clearly-distinct mechanisms with explicit weighting or switching logic. The weighting/switching itself must be principled (e.g. data-driven, schedule-based) rather than an arbitrary linear combination of magic constants.

You must NOT cross categories. If your variant computes something that
properly belongs to a different category (e.g. you were assigned 'Geometry'
but you end up doing eigendecomposition, which is 'Spectral'), STOP and
re-design within the assigned category.

Universal requirements:
- Keep the EXACT function signature: `def _mutate_batch(self, population, fitness, ring_prev, ring_next):`
- You may read any `self` attribute but do NOT modify `__init__` or other methods
- The fenced code block must contain ONLY the single replacement function
- Ensure numerical robustness (no division by zero, handle edge dims, clip to bounds)

WHY PER-TASK COVERAGE MATTERS:
After all variants are generated, an ADAPTIVE algorithm will be built that
selects (or blends) operators FOR EACH TASK at runtime. This means:
- We do NOT need a single variant that wins everywhere.
- We DO need at least one variant that reaches error <= 1e-08 on EACH task.
- Tasks marked UNSOLVED below are critical gaps. The bigger the remaining
  error, the higher the priority — your variant should specifically target
  the WORST unsolved tasks at the top of the priority list, AS APPROACHED
  THROUGH THE LENS OF YOUR ASSIGNED CATEGORY.

TASK COVERAGE SUMMARY: 0 SOLVED (<= 1e-08), 24 UNSOLVED (of which 0 crashed) — out of 24.
Goal: drive every task to error <= 1e-08. Focus first on the WORST unsolved tasks (top of the UNSOLVED list).

LABELS OF PREVIOUSLY PROPOSED VARIANTS (do NOT repeat these ideas):
Idea 0, Idea 0, Idea 0

CATEGORY ROTATION SO FAR (per-category proposal count):
  A×1  B×1  C×1  D×0  E×0  F×0  G×0  H×0

Your new proposal MUST be designed to crush the error on the WORST unsolved
tasks above, USING THE MECHANISMS OF YOUR ASSIGNED CATEGORY (see below).
It is acceptable — even expected — for the new variant to be worse than
existing variants on already-SOLVED tasks; the adaptive selector will
handle that.

Reason explicitly about the priority targets:
1. What property of those WORST unsolved tasks (multimodality, ill-
   conditioning, separability, ruggedness, deceptive local optima, narrow
   basins, non-separable rotation, etc.) is preventing existing operators
   from reaching 1e-08? Use the per-task error magnitudes as
   evidence — errors stuck at ~1e+1 vs ~1e-3 vs ~1e-6 imply different
   failure modes.
2. How does YOUR ASSIGNED CATEGORY ('Temporal / dynamical') give you a fundamentally
   different angle of attack on those obstacles than the prior variants
   in different categories?
3. What concrete computation, distinctive to 'Temporal / dynamical', will you use?
